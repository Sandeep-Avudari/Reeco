# The Reeco Project handles the status of the Orders and Order Items.
# Here We are implemented functionality Points are 
  # Initially We are showing Number of Orders,
  # then Edit the Orders, we can see List of Items of Order,
  # We can Approve the Order based on Shipping time,
  # Once the Order is Approved then next we are unable to update the Items Status, 
  # And we can also Changes the Status of Order Item,
  # And Also posible for updating the Price and quantity of Items.

# We are using 
  # Redux ToolKit for store management,
  # For Integrations (async calls) we are used Redux ToolKit with createAsyncThunk,
  # For Network calls Axios,
  # And for Routing we used react-router-dom.
